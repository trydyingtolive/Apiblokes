# Apiblokes

Apiblokes is a silly little game that I created to help teach a workshop at [CITN](churchitnetwork.com/) in October of 2025. The talk was about how to write code that was reusable and testable. The issue I ran into is that design principles often do not make sense outside of the context they were originally designed for. As a result I created this project to discuss how I would solve real problems using design principles that actually worked.

## Premise

Apiblokes is loosely based on Pokemon. But instead of a graphical game, it is a game that can be accessed through telnet. (Initially, it was an API game. It turns out that APIs are not very fun.) You play on a 10x10 grid you can move around and capture Apiblokes. There are different types based on people you might find in an IT department. You can battle them, capture them and turn them in for Apibucks. The goal is to capture all 6 types including the rare one person IT department. Each corner of the map has a usable item and there are signs around the map.

The game is mildly fun to play and was wildly fun to program.
